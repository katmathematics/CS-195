Before the decision, race already wasn’t a factor in Drake University admissions, according to Provost Sue Mattison.\n","“Affirmative action, with regards to admissions, only impacts those really highly selective institutions that limit the number of incoming students,” Mattison said. “So that doesn’t apply to Drake and most institutions across the country.”\n","She said schools like Harvard and UNC have enough applicants that they can pick and choose which applicants fill a certain number of spots.\n","Drake’s admissions team found that the university has “admitted all students who have a 3.0 high school GPA or [higher],” Mattison said. “Even though we’ve asked for a person’s race on the admissions form, it does not have an impact on the admissions decision, and it doesn’t displace anybody.”\n","Possible effects of the court’s ruling\n","Mark Kende, director of Drake’s Constitutional Law Center, said the Supreme Court “basically has embraced an idea that it calls colorblindness.”\n","“If you take their principle of colorblindness and extend it beyond universities, to other places, it could raise some problems,” Kende said. “But we don’t know yet.”\n","Financial aid programs that prioritize applicants of a particular race over another are more vulnerable after the court’s decision, according to Kende. He said it’s not clear what impact the decision might have on university hiring practices that consider an employee’s race, as well as corporations’ diversity programs.\n","Following the Supreme Court’s decision, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said Missouri institutions subject to the U.S. Constitution or Title VI must stop using race-based standards “to make decisions about things like admissions, scholarships, programs and employment.”\n","The University of Missouri System said that “a small number of our programs and scholarships have used race/ethnicity as a factor for admissions and scholarships,” and that “these practices will be discontinued.”\n","Drake is taking a different approach in the wake of the affirmative action decision. The university is monitoring maybe about forty to fifty scholarships, according to Ryan Zantingh, Drake’s director of financial aid. This is more in anticipation of a comparable case on financial aid that considers race, rather than a reaction to the affirmative action ruling.\n","Mattison said she thinks Drake is still trying to determine how the Supreme Court decision will impact Drake’s Crew Scholars program, which is for incoming students of color.\n","“There are ways that we can ensure that we continue Crew Scholars while still being compliant,” Mattison said.\n","Donors for some Drake scholarships specified that they wanted to support a student of color or a woman in a STEM field, Mattison said.\n","“And so we’re still working through what that actually means, and what we have to do to continue to achieve the values that we expect,” Mattison said. “There are ways that we can change the wording of some of the scholarships.”\n","Like all students, students of color may qualify for scholarships for first-generation students or students with financial need.\n","“There’s a lot of overlap between students of color and other areas where financial aid is directed,” Zantingh said. “Scholarship resources can be directed [to financial need or first generation status] and still reach the same students.”\n","Even if there is a ruling on financial aid that’s comparable to the affirmative action decision, Zantingh doesn’t expect a large impact on Drake financial aid from either decision.\n","“There may be some implications, but I think the overall general effect on students will be little to none,” Zantingh said.\n","Zantingh gave an example of scholarship language offered by legal counsel. If a scholarship is for only minority students, it might become a scholarship that gives preference to students who demonstrate a commitment to Drake’s vision for diversity on campus.\n","“If a white student is actively involved in anti-racist leadership here on campus, certainly they would fit that description then, wouldn’t they?” Zantingh said. “Basically, the language would not seek to exclude any particular protected class categorically.”\n","In some cases, a donor might be unwilling to change the scholarship’s language or be deceased, Zantingh said. If a donor is deceased, a judge might approve changes. He said he doesn’t expect Drake to cut any of the scholarships it is monitoring.\n","“The scholarship criteria would have to change, or the dollars would have to be repurposed in another way. Per either the donor or a court’s approval,” Zantingh said.\n","Race can still play a role in college admissions\n","The Supreme Court left at least one legal path open for race to play a role in college admissions.\n","When admitting students, universities are allowed to consider “an applicant’s discussion of how race affected his or her life, be it through discrimination, inspiration or otherwise,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the Court’s decision. However, “the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual — not on the basis of race.”\n","A student’s story can emerge without Drake asking for it, according to Dean of Admissions Joel Johnson.\n","“Especially if they’ve overcome a lot, or it’s so key to their identity… it’ll come out on its own,” Johnson said. “I don’t know if I could say the Supreme Court protected it. They couldn’t have stopped it, honestly.”\n","Johnson said that caring about diversity also means intentionally recruiting a diverse group of students. He said students can’t join Drake if they never apply in the first place.\n","In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision on affirmative action, The Times-Delphic is publishing a series. Check next week’s paper for an article about legacy admissions and legacy financial aid with a Drake focus.\n","\n","\"\"\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"j3SIsf6JWR7z","outputId":"66981747-667e-4d56-98d6-986e3b534c29","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694120570530,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":122,"user":{"displayName":"Katja Mathesius","userId":"05730695603903920499"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["6089"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}],"source":["len(times_delphic_story) #let's check how long this string is"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cUhvPJQ-WR70","outputId":"555f28fc-eba5-47d2-cffd-003d9d246fb2","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1694120746706,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":28431,"user":{"displayName":"Katja Mathesius","userId":"05730695603903920499"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[{'summary_text': 'The Supreme Court ruled against the admissions programs of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina in an affirmative action decision.

These organizations help preserve the memories and incidents of the great hostilities fought by our nation, and preserve and strengthen comradeship among members.\\n(2) These veterans’ organizations also own and manage various properties including lodges, posts, and fraternal halls. These properties act as a safe haven where veterans of all ages and their families can gather together to find camaraderie and fellowship, share stories, and seek support from people who understand their unique experiences. This aids in the healing process for these returning veterans, and ensures their health and happiness.\\n(b) As a result of congressional chartering of these veterans’ organizations, the United States Internal Revenue Service created a special tax exemption for these organizations under Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n(c) Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code and related federal regulations provide for the exemption for posts or organizations of war veterans, or an auxiliary unit or society of, or a trust or foundation for, any such post or organization that, among other attributes, carries on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, conducts programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, sponsors or participates in activities of a patriotic nature, and provides social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(d) Section 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code stipulates that all buildings, support and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which ensures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, are exempt from taxation.\\n(e) The Chief Counsel of the State Board of Equalization concluded, based on a 1979 appellate court decision, that only parts of American Legion halls are exempt from property taxation and that other parts, such as billiard rooms, card rooms, and similar areas, are not exempt.\\n(f) In a 1994 memorandum, the State Board of Equalization’s legal division further concluded that the areas normally considered eligible for exemptions are the office areas used to counsel veterans and the area used to store veterans’ records, but that the meeting hall and bar found in most of the facilities are not considered used for charitable purposes.\\n(g) Tax-exempt status is intended to provide economic incentive and support to veterans’ organizations to provide for the social welfare of the community of current and former military personnel.\\n(h) The State Board of Equalization’s constriction of the tax exemption has resulted in an onerous tax burden on California veteran service organizations posts or halls, hinders the posts’ ability to provide facilities for veterans, and threatens the economic viability of many local organizations.\\n(i) The charitable activities of a veteran service organizations post or hall are much more than the counseling of veterans. The requirements listed for qualification for the federal tax exemption clearly dictate a need for more than just an office.\\n(j) Programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors require the use of facilities for funerals and receptions.\\n(k) Programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes require space for more than 50 attendees.\\n(l) Activities of a patriotic nature need facilities to accommodate hundreds of people.\\n(m) Social and recreational activities for members require precisely those areas considered “not used for charitable purposes” by the State Board of Equalization.\\n(n) The State Board of Equalization’s interpretation of the Revenue and Taxation Code reflects a lack of understanding of the purpose and programs of the veterans service organizations posts or halls and is detrimental to the good works performed in support of our veteran community.\\nSECTION 1.\\nSEC. 2.\\nSection 215.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to read:\\n215.1.\\n(a) All buildings, and so much of the real property on which the buildings are situated as may be required for the convenient use and occupation of the buildings, used exclusively for charitable purposes, owned by a veterans’ organization that has been chartered by the Congress of the United States, organized and operated for charitable purposes, and exempt from federal income tax as an organization described in Section 501(c)(19) of the Internal Revenue Code when the same are used solely and exclusively for the purpose of the organization, if not conducted for profit and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private individual or member thereof, shall be exempt from taxation.\\n(b) The exemption provided for in this section shall apply to the property of all organizations meeting the requirements of this section, subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution, and paragraphs (1) to (4), inclusive, (6), and (7) of subdivision (a) of Section 214.\\n(c) (1) The exemption specified by subdivision (a) shall not be denied to a property on the basis that the property is used for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes.\\n(2) With regard to this subdivision, the Legislature finds and declares all of the following:\\n(A) The exempt activities of a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) qualitatively differ from the exempt activities of other nonprofit entities that use property for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes in that the exempt purpose of the veterans’ organization is to conduct programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors, to conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, to sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature, and to provide social and recreational activities for their members.\\n(B) In light of this distinction, the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a), for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes is central to that organization’s exempt purposes and activities.\\n(C) In light of the factors set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B), the use of real property by a veterans’ organization as described in subdivision (a) for fraternal, lodge, or social club purposes, constitutes the exclusive use of that property for a charitable purpose within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 4 of Article XIII of the California Constitution.\\n(d) The exemption provided for in this section shall not apply to any portion of a property that consists of a bar where alcoholic beverages are served.
